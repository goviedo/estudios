Como se ve en la primera linea , todos los request deben ser autenticados, este es el comportamiento por defecto.

Como se ve a continuacion, esto funciona tanto para llamadas rest como llamadas http request normales.

Â¿Como entonces genero mi propio filtro de seguridad?.

Como dice la documentaciÃ³n, especificando su propio Bean de SecurityFilterChain.

# DSL para programar

IMPORTANT NOTE

#### ðŸ‘‰ IMPORTANT NOTE [May 26, 2023]

Starting fromÂ **Spring Security 6.1**Â andÂ **Spring Boot 3.1.0**Â versions, the Spring Security framework team **recommends using the Lambda DSL style** for configuring security for APIs, web paths, etc. Consequently, they have deprecated a few methods within the framework. These deprecated methods are planned to be removed inÂ **Spring Security 7**, which is expected to be released in the next 2-3 years. This timeframe allows all developers sufficient time for migrating their code.

However, there's no need to worry as this change does not alter the underlying concepts, . Instead of using normal Java configurations, we will now employ the Lambda DSL. Below, you will find an example code snippet illustrating the differences between the two styles:

**With out Lambda DSL**

**With Lambda DSL**

Please note that the course is recorded using Spring Boot 3 and Spring Security 6 versions, where normal Java style configurations are used instead of Lambda DSL. Therefore, I encourage you to follow the videos to understand the concepts, methods, configurations, etc., and try to use Lambda DSL style configurations.

For your reference,Â **I have updated the code in the GitHub repository to use the Lambda DSL style**. You should be able to comprehend the Lambda DSL style, but if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me.

**The Lambda DSL was created to accomplish to following goals:**

- Automatic indentation makes the configuration more readable.
    
- The is no need to chain configuration options usingÂ `.and()`
    
- The Spring Security DSL has a similar configuration style to other Spring DSLs such as Spring Integration and Spring Cloud Gateway.
